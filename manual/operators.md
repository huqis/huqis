## Comparison

- ``!=``: True when left and right are not the same
- ``!==``: True when left and right are the not same or not of the same type
- ``>``: True when left is greater than right
- ``>=``: True when left is greater than or equals to right
- ``<``: True when left is less than right
- ``<=``: True when left is less than or equals to right
- ``~=``: True when left matches the regular expression which is right

## Math
